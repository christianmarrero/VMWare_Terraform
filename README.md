# VMWare_Terraform

This terraform scripts will deploy some OVA to a Content Library for future use.

Also will deploy and power on some CentOS7 as well Windows Server 2016 VMs.

On this version, still working on the Networking for each VM which may need to re-do the OVA with the proper Network. Other notes is the Host DATA Sources is to static to a single host so we may need to work more on it or see if we can then add the Cluster Name under the Resource Pool Data Source.

Variables need to be modify by SE before Deploying.
